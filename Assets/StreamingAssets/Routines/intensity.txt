<b>Exercise Intensity</b>
The <b>Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)</b> Scale is a way to measure the level of exertion you feel during physical activity.
It is useful to help you manage the intensity of your exercise.
Generally, a person doing moderate-intensity activity can talk, but not sing, during the activity; a person doing vigorous-intensity activity cannot say more than a few words without pausing for breath.
