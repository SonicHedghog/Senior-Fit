•	150-300 minutes (2½-5 hours) per week of MODERATE-intensity activity OR
•	75-150 minutes (1¼-2½ hours) per week of VIGOROUS-intensity activity
•	3-5 days per week (30-60 minutes per day)
Weekly activity can be a combination of moderate and vigorous intensities.  Generally, 1 minute of vigorous activity is equal to 2 minutes of moderate activity.  More activity = more health benefits.  Always consult with your doctor before beginning a new exercise routine.
