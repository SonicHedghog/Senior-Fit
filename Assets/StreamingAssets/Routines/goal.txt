Warming up (performing aerobic or strength activity at lighter intensity) is important to all a gradual increase in heart rate and breathing, before starting a higher intensity activity.
This helps to prepare your body for exercise and may help reduce muscle soreness and lessen the risk of injury.
Cooling down after exercise involves returning to a lighter intensity aerobic or strength activity to allow a gradual recovery back to pre-exercise heart rate and blood pressure.
Warm-up and cool-down should last 5-10 minutes and may count toward meeting the recommended activity guidelines if the activity is at least moderate intensity.
