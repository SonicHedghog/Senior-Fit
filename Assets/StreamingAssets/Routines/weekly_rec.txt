<b>Weekly Recommendations</b>
<b>Aerobic Activity Recommendations</b>
<b>•</b> 150-300 minutes (2½-5 hours) per week of MODERATE-intensity activity OR
<b>•</b> 75-150 minutes (1¼-2½ hours) per week of VIGOROUS-intensity activity
<b>•</b> 3-5 days per week (30-60 minutes per day)

<b>Intensity -</b> Weekly activity can be a combination of moderate and vigorous intensities.
Generally, 1 minute of vigorous activity is equal to 2 minutes of moderate activity.
More activity = more health benefits.
<b>Always</b> consult with your doctor before beginning a new exercise routine.

<b>Strengthening Recommendations</b>
<b>•</b> 8-12 repetitions per exercise, 1-3 sets of repetitions
<b>•</b> At least 2 days per week

<b>Exercises -</b> Muscle-strengthening activities should include a variety of exercises to strengthen all major muscle groups and joints (legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms).

<b>Weight -</b> The appropriate weight, number of repetitions, and sets of repetitions is determined by the amount of each that it takes to perform the exercise to the point that it would be difficult to do another repetition.

<b>Progression -</b> Always begin with a lower amount of weight to be safe then, when you can perform 12 repetitions easily, slightly increase the weight or add another set of repetitions. Continue gradually increasing to progress over time.
