<b>Warm-up/Cool-down</b>

<b>Warm-up -</b> Warming up (performing aerobic or strength activity at lighter intensity) is important to all for a gradual increase in heart rate and breathing, before starting a higher intensity activity.
This helps to prepare your body for exercise and may help reduce muscle soreness and lessen the risk of injury.

<b>Cool-down -</b> Cooling down after exercise involves returning to a lighter intensity aerobic or strength activity to allow a gradual recovery back to pre-exercise heart rate and blood pressure.

Warm-up and cool-down should last <b>5-10 minutes</b> and may count toward meeting the recommended activity guidelines if the activity is at least moderate intensity.
